The semester was a bit hectic so I feel I haven't achieved much mostly relying on my partner. Let' have another crack at this üëç

This is printf adapted for windows
----
Apparently, the linux write() syscall cannot be used on windows 
ChatGPT says:

**"No, the write() system call is specific to Unix and Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS. Windows has a different API for performing similar operations, which is called the Windows API.
In Windows, you can use functions like WriteFile() or WriteConsole() to write data to a file or console, respectively. These functions are part of the Windows API and can be accessed by including the appropriate header files and linking against the necessary libraries."**
